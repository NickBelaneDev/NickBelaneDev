- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @NickBelaneDev
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning Python, automating my daily workflow and experimenting with databases.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning learning Python and mySQL.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Programming Minecraft scripts with Skript is what led me to become a software developer. I was tired of wasting my time by managing my building habits with my Stream Deck only. So I build a texture editor as my first project and yep, that's how it started.
- Oh and before I was building scripts with SoundFlow to improve my audio post-production processes. I'm also a studied musician and I'm running a small audio company. We often have to bounce thousands of single sound files and this is exhausting if you need to do it manually. Thank you SoundFlow for solving that problem, you're the best! <3
